# HerMatchUp

HerMatchUp is a swipe-based mentorship and connection platform tailored for girls and women in STEM. The platform provides an intuitive and emotionally intelligent environment where users can discover mentors, collaborators, or supportive peers based on shared academic fields, career goals, personality traits, and availability.

Unlike traditional mentorship platforms, HerMatchUp uses a familiar swipe-based interface and inclusive logic, allowing every user to be both a mentor and a mentee. It aims to break down barriers in STEM by fostering meaningful, supportive, and personalized connections.

## Purpose

Many girls and women in STEM struggle to find mentorship or community that understands their unique challenges. Existing platforms often lack emotional relevance, personalization, or are overly formal. HerMatchUp bridges this gap through an intuitive design and inclusive logic, creating a space that encourages support, collaboration, and long-term growth.

## How It Works

1. Users sign up and complete their profile with STEM interests, career goals, availability, and personality traits.
2. Users can swipe on others to express interest in connecting.
3. When two users match (i.e., both express interest), they can begin chatting.
4. All users can be both mentors and mentees depending on context and expertise.
